    "# Week 6: text mining\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to use text mining to predict the rating of a dress from online reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict whether dresses reviews are positive (>3 stars) or neutral/negative (<4 stars).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain briefly in your own words how the bag-of-words model and Naïve Bayes work, and how they work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're going to do is getting all the words out of the review text and counting them so we know the probability that certain words appear in a rated review. After that you can calculate the rating of new messages because we know what the chance is that a certain messsage is negative, based on the value of the words in it. \n",
    "Because the model is naive, it only gives value to words, not to the structure of how certain words are used in a sentense. Because of the ignoring of relationships among words, the model has a high bias. But, it works very well in practice, that gives it a low variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre processing steps\n",
    "- Pre-processing steps (don’t forget to filter out all non-dress reviews).\n",
    "- The head() of the resulting dataframe."
